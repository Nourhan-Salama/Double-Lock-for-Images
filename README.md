# Double-Lock-for-Images
## Descreption
This project safeguards images with a powerful two-step encryption process.  First, AES scrambles the data like a high-tech vault (implementation: encrypt image). Then, RSA hides it within another image for an extra layer of security (implementation: hide_encrypted_image). This double encryption (including decryption: decrypt image and extraction: extract_hidden_image) makes unauthorized access extremely difficult.
